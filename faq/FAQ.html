<summary><b>What is the role of son goku in dragon ball?</b></summary>

He is a Saiyan raised on Earth who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman abilities. 
He goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, which can grant any wish, and to protect the Earth from various threats. 
He is also the husband of Chi-Chi, the father of Gohan and Goten, and the grandfather of Pan12. 
He is based on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King from the Chinese novel Journey to the West2.</p>

<summary><b>What will happen if goku is not there in dragon ball?</b></summary>
<p>if Goku never met Bulma and never left his home in Mount Paozu, he would have lived a peaceful life until the arrival of the Red Ribbon Army, who were also looking for the Dragon Balls. 
They would have eventually found him and either killed him or captured him for their experiments. 
If he somehow survived, he would have faced an even greater threat from King Piccolo, who escaped from his seal and tried to conquer the world. 
Goku would have been no match for him and his minions, and would have either died or lived under his tyranny.
Even if Goku somehow managed to overcome these enemies, he would have faced more powerful foes from outer space, such as his brother Raditz, who came to Earth to recruit him for the Saiyan invasion. 
Without Goku’s help, the other Z Fighters would have been easily defeated by Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta, and the Earth would have been destroyed or enslaved by them. 
If not, then Frieza would have eventually come to Earth to find the Dragon Balls and achieve immortality, and he would have killed everyone in his way.
The list goes on, as Goku’s absence would have also affected the events of Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball GT, where he faced even more powerful enemies such as Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu, Jiren and many others. 
Without Goku’s intervention, training, friendship and influence, many of these villains would have succeeded in their evil plans and caused unimaginable destruction and suffering to countless lives.
So, in summary, if Goku was not there in Dragon Ball, the Earth and the universe would have been doomed many times over by various villains who sought to destroy or dominate them. 
Goku’s presence was essential for the survival and prosperity of his friends, family and all living beings.</p>
